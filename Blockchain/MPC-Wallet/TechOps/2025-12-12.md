## Q&As

### Q1: Closing the MPC Blind Signing Gap

**Phase**: Development, Operations & Observability | **Roles**: Developer, Security Engineer, SRE, Product Manager | **Category**: Security | **Criticality**: 1, 2, 3, 4

**News**: Hypernative highlights that while MPC solved key management, many institutional flows still rely on "blind" transaction approval, where signers cannot see full downstream behavior. Their 2025 analysis argues that complex DeFi interactions, proxy contracts, and upgraded logic allow malicious payloads to hide inside seemingly routine transactions without deep simulation and threat-aware context in the signing flow. [Ref: N2][n2]

**Impact**:
- Development: MPC stacks that lack intent-aware simulation expose all MPC-secured assets to protocol-level risks; target reducing unsimulated high-value DeFi transactions from ~100% to <5% within 3 months.
- Operations & Observability: Incident response today often starts after funds are drained; goal is to move detection to pre-chain simulation with >95% coverage for treasury and institutional flows.

  Sim -->|High Risk| Block[Block / Require Extra Approval]
  MPC --> Chain[Blockchain]
```

**Stakeholders**:
- Developers: Need to integrate simulation APIs and richer decoding into MPC wallet UIs and signing daemons.
- Security Engineers: Define risk policies (e.g., block unknown contract upgrades, anomalous approvals) and threat intelligence feeds consumed by simulation.
- SRE/Operations: Monitor simulation coverage, latency, and fail-open vs fail-closed behavior.
- Product Managers: Balance user experience with stricter prompts and additional approval steps for high-risk flows.

**Decision**:
- Alternatives:
  - A: Minimal simulation (token transfers only). Cost: low; Benefit: slight UX improvement; Risk: high residual DeFi exploit exposure.
  - B: Full intent-aware simulation with threat classification and policy integration for high-value flows. Cost: medium; Benefit: materially reduced protocol-exploit loss probability; Risk: added latency and complexity.
- Recommendation: Adopt B for all treasury and institutional flows; maintain A only for low-value consumer interactions with strict limits.
- Success Criteria: Pre-chain simulation coverage for institutional flows from 0% → >95%; zero blind-signed treasury incidents over next 12 months (tracked via incident register).
- Limitations: Simulation cannot perfectly model all L2/L3 side effects; teams must still assume some residual risk and maintain withdrawal limits and circuit breakers.

| Option | Cost | Benefit | Risk | Timeline |
|--------|------|---------|------|----------|
| A | Low | Simple, minimal latency | High residual exploit risk | 0–1 mo |
| B | Medium | Strong reduction in blind-signing exposure | Added latency, integration effort | 1–3 mo |

**Action**:
- Immediate (0–2 wk): Inventory all MPC signing flows; tag high-value DeFi and treasury transactions; define simulation requirements (coverage, latency, fail-closed rules). Owner: Security Engineer + Product Manager.
- Short-term (2 wk–2 mo): Roll out simulation in staging then production for tagged flows; add dashboards for simulation coverage and blocked transactions; test incident runbooks for simulation failures. Owner: Developer + SRE.

### Q2: 21X–Cordial Zero-Trust MPC Connectivity

**Phase**: Architecture & Design, Deploy & Release | **Roles**: Architect, DevOps, SRE, Compliance Officer | **Category**: Infrastructure/Regulation | **Criticality**: 1, 2, 3

**News**: On 26 June 2025, regulated DLT trading venue 21X announced a collaboration with Cordial Systems to make Cordial’s self-hosted, zero-trust MPC wallet infrastructure natively compatible with 21X. Institutional participants can connect via MPC-based wallets while maintaining full control over keys, data, and governance, enabling direct on-chain trading and settlement of tokenized equities, bonds, and funds under the EU DLT Regime. [Ref: N1][n1]

**Impact**:
- Architecture & Design: Custody and trading connectivity converge; institutions must design MPC stacks that support segregated wallet policies per venue, strong IAM integration, and audit-ready logs across 50+ chains.
- Deploy & Release: New connectivity paths to regulated venues introduce change-management risk; release pipelines must include venue-specific integration tests, rollback plans, and segregation between trading and treasury vaults.

  Gateway --> Venue[21X DLT Trading & Settlement]
  Custody --> Treasury[Treasury / Cold MPC]
  Venue <--> Market[Tokenized Securities Markets]
```

**Stakeholders**:
- Architects: Define reference architectures for venue connectivity, segregation of trading vs treasury wallets, and zero-trust boundaries.
- DevOps/SRE: Manage connectivity endpoints, certificates, and deployment pipelines; monitor latency and error budgets for trade flows.
- Compliance Officer: Ensure policies enforce regulatory constraints (whitelists, asset restrictions, jurisdictional blocks) and that logs satisfy audit requirements.

**Decision**:
- Alternatives:
  - A: Rely on third-party custodial connectors to 21X while keeping internal MPC only for treasury.
  - B: Extend internal self-hosted, zero-trust MPC to connect directly to 21X, unifying governance and audit.
- Recommendation: For institutions with sufficient scale and regulatory obligations, adopt B to maintain end-to-end control and reduce counterparty risk; smaller teams may temporarily use A.
- Success Criteria: 100% of 21X trades initiated from policy-controlled MPC wallets; time-to-approve trade instructions < 5 minutes; audit queries executable in < 1 hour.
- Limitations: Direct MPC connectivity increases internal operational responsibility (24/7 monitoring, HSM/TEE management) and may require new certifications.

| Option | Cost | Benefit | Risk | Timeline |
|--------|------|---------|------|----------|
| A | Medium | Faster onboarding via third parties | Higher counterparty and outage risk | 0–2 mo |
| B | High | Full custody control, unified governance | Higher internal ops burden | 3–6 mo |

**Action**:
- Immediate (0–2 wk): Map current custody architecture and trading connectivity; identify where third parties hold keys or critical infrastructure. Owner: Architect.
- Short-term (2 wk–2 mo): Design and prototype a zero-trust MPC connectivity layer to regulated venues (starting with 21X); define SLAs, logging standards, and incident response runbooks for trade settlement failures. Owner: Architect + DevOps + Compliance.

### Q3: Trustless MPC Custody vs Traditional Models

**Phase**: Architecture & Design, Operations & Observability | **Roles**: Security Architect, Engineering Manager, Treasury/Ops | **Category**: Security/Practices | **Criticality**: 2, 3, 4

**News**: io.finnet’s June 2025 guide on MPC custody compares traditional multisig, cold storage, third-party custodians, and trustless MPC custody. They argue that distributing keys into cryptographic shares, enforcing programmable policy engines, and generating audit-ready logs allows institutions to reduce insider and external compromise risk while retaining operational resilience and automation. [Ref: N3][n3]

**Impact**:
- Architecture & Design: Moving to trustless MPC changes the threat model: no single signer or HSM can unilaterally move funds; policies and automation become first-class design artifacts.
- Operations & Observability: Teams must operate MPC clusters, monitor policy enforcement, and continuously validate that audit trails match regulatory requirements.

**Stakeholders**:
- Security Architect: Owns custody model selection and policy design.
- Engineering Manager: Balances build vs buy for MPC infrastructure and integration scope.
- Treasury/Ops: Defines operational constraints (cut-off times, withdrawal limits, asset lists).

**Decision**:
- Alternatives:
  - A: Retain legacy multisig + cold storage for most assets, adding MPC only at the edge.
  - B: Migrate core hot and warm custody to trustless MPC with programmable policy and verifiable logs.
- Recommendation: Gradually adopt B for assets and flows where automation and auditability materially reduce operational and regulatory risk, starting with lower-risk chains and assets.
- Success Criteria: Share of hot/warm assets under trustless MPC rises from 0% → >60% in 12 months; no material custody incidents where audit logs are incomplete.
- Limitations: Trustless MPC still depends on robust operational practices (backups, DR drills); not all regulators have explicit MPC guidance yet, so coordination with legal/compliance is required.

**Action**:
- Immediate (0–2 wk): Perform a custody model gap analysis vs io.finnet’s dimensions (governance, audit, automation); identify target asset classes for first-wave migration. Owner: Security Architect.
- Short-term (2 wk–2 mo): Run PoCs with at least one trustless MPC provider; define SLOs and monitoring for key-share health, policy engine uptime, and audit log completeness. Owner: Engineering Manager.

### Q4: Planning for MPC Wallet Market Growth and Standardization

**Phase**: Architecture & Design, Development, Operations & Observability | **Roles**: Architect, Engineering Manager, Compliance Officer, Product Manager | **Category**: Infrastructure/Standards | **Criticality**: 1, 3, 4, 5

**News**: Fystack’s 2025 MPC wallet news roundup cites Intel Market Research numbers: the global MPC wallet market grew from $65.3M in 2024 to $70.8M in 2025 and is projected to reach $137M by 2031 (8.2% CAGR), while hardware wallets show only 3–4% annual growth and multisig SaaS is slowing. [Ref: N4][n4] In parallel, Fireblocks led a cross-industry coalition asking NIST to accelerate MPC cryptography standardization, noting that MPC already secures trillions of dollars of assets but still lacks formal U.S. technical standards. [Ref: N5][n5]

**Impact**:
- Architecture & Design: Growing MPC adoption plus upcoming standards imply future protocol migrations (e.g., GG-18/GG-20/other schemes) and possible certification requirements.
- Development & Operations: Wallet teams must design upgradeable MPC layers, feature flags, and migration playbooks that avoid downtime and signing failures during protocol or vendor changes.

**Stakeholders**:
- Architect: Designs abstraction layers so business logic is decoupled from specific MPC protocols or vendors.
- Engineering Manager: Plans resourcing for protocol migration and regression testing.
- Compliance Officer: Tracks NIST and other regulatory guidance; defines certification roadmap.
- Product Manager: Aligns roadmap with customer expectations around auditability and third-party attestation.

**Decision**:
- Alternatives:
  - A: Lock into a single MPC vendor and protocol with minimal abstraction.
  - B: Invest in a vendor- and protocol-agnostic MPC abstraction layer, with explicit support for future standard-compliant schemes.
- Recommendation: Adopt B for institutional and enterprise-grade products; A may be acceptable only for narrow, low-risk consumer products with clear migration clauses.
- Success Criteria: Ability to switch MPC providers or upgrade protocols with <1 hour of downtime and no loss of signing capability; completion of at least one dry-run migration in non-production in the next 6 months.
- Limitations: Abstraction layers add complexity and may reduce access to vendor-specific optimizations; smaller teams must balance this against delivery velocity.

**Action**:
- Immediate (0–2 wk): Catalog all MPC dependencies (protocols, vendors, libraries) and map them to business-critical flows; identify hard coupling areas. Owner: Architect.
- Short-term (2 wk–2 mo): Define an MPC abstraction layer, including interface contracts, migration hooks, and test harnesses; monitor NIST and industry standardization progress to align with emerging recommendations. Owner: Engineering Manager + Compliance Officer.
